---

## üìã Content Guidelines

### Tone of Voice
- **Professional and Trustworthy:** You're dealing with vehicle safety and compliance
- **Clear and Direct:** Dealership managers value efficiency - no fluff
- **Solution-Oriented:** Focus on solving problems, not just listing features
- **Industry-Savvy:** Use automotive terminology appropriately (DMS, OEM, recalls, technicians)

Bad examples (too vague, dilutes current offering):

- "Coming soon: everything you need" ‚ùå
- Long lists of future features without focusing on Vehix ‚ùå

**Where to Mention Multi-Product Strategy:**
- ‚úÖ About page (prominent, detailed)
- ‚úÖ Footer ("Product" section with "Coming Soon")
- ‚úÖ Optional homepage section (brief, 2-3 sentences)
- ‚úÖ Newsletter signup ("Be first to hear about new products")
- ‚ùå NOT in hero headline
- ‚ùå NOT in primary product descriptions
- ‚ùå NOT in pricing page
